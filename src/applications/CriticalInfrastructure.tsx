          The Adaptive Regulatory Compliance System (ARCS) formula,
          conceptualized by James Scott, brings an unparalleled level of detail,
          agility, and foresight to critical infrastructure cybersecurity.
          Designed as an adaptive, real-time compliance framework, ARCS
          transcends traditional static compliance systems by integrating
          advanced technologies—such as AI-driven predictive analytics, quantum
          computing, and influence mapping—into a cohesive model. It addresses
          not only the complex and dynamic regulatory needs of critical
          infrastructure operators but also prepares them to face the emerging
          threats in today's rapidly evolving cyber landscape.
